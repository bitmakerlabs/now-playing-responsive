# Now Playing

This is a simple app that pulls the most popular movies currently playing in cinemas. It provides a basic skeleton for creating a responsive design based on this content.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Run `rails db:setup`. This will create your database schema and seed it with popular films.
3. Run 'rails s' to start the server
4. Visit 'http://localhost:3000' to see the starting layout.

## Assignment

Our movie app's single-column, mobile-first design has been implemented. It's up to us to turn this into a responsive design for devices of all sizes.
